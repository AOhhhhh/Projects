Engineering Portfolio
Welcome to my projects repository. This collection highlights my work at the intersection of mechanical engineering, fluid dynamics, and aerospace software, with a focus on simulation and high-stakes hardware design.

#Featured Projects
2D Baseball Pitch Fluid Dynamics Simulation
An exploration into the aerodynamics of various baseball pitches. This project utilizes Python-based CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) to model how seam orientation and spin rate (Magnus effect) influence pressure differentials and trajectory.

Key Features: Automated mesh generation for spherical geometries and visualization of wake turbulence.

Stack: Python, Matplotlib, NumPy.

React CubeSat Visualizer
A web-based dashboard designed to display telemetry data and orientation for a 3U CubeSat. It provides real-time 3D rendering of the satellite's attitude using quaternion data.

Key Features: Interactive 3D model, real-time sensor data charting, and a mock-telemetry API.

Stack: React, Three.js (react-three-fiber), Tailwind CSS.

UW Orbital - Mechanical Team
Documentation and design files from my time on the University of Waterloo's satellite design team. This folder includes FEA (Finite Element Analysis) reports and CAD assemblies for structural components designed to survive launch vibrations and thermal cycling.

Key Features: Vibration isolation mounts and thermal strap design calculations.

Tools: SolidWorks, Ansys, MATLAB.
