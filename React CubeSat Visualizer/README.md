## Overview
This project is a high-performance visualization tool designed to bridge the gap between complex hardware telemetry and accessible data storytelling. It processes heterogeneous datasets to provide a unified, 3D view of vehicle health and geospatial movement.

## Key Features
- **Real-time Geospatial Rendering:** Visualizes trajectories with millisecond precision using Deck.gl layers.
- **Dynamic Heatmapping:** Aggregates sensor data into live heatmaps for trend analysis.
- **Optimized UI:** Handles high-frequency data updates at a smooth 60FPS without UI lag.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** JavaScript (ES6+), Python, MATLAB
- **Libraries:** React, Deck.gl, Recharts, Mapbox
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

## How to Run
1. Clone the repo: `git clone [url]`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Start the dashboard: `npm run dev`
